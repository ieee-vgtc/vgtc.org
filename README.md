# Archived version of vgtc.org

Until 2020-06-18, vgtc.org was hosted statically on S3 buckets, and this repository stores the markdown version of the site.
From 2020-06-18 throughout, vgtc.org will be hosted directly by IEEE CS, on https://tc.computer.org/vgtc

## TL;dr

* It's a Jekyll site
* the markdown source is in `src/`
  * But many of the pages are still in HTML
* It used to build and deploy using travis-ci.org from `master` and `production` branches directly into staging.vgtc.org and vgtc.org. It's now been deactivated.
