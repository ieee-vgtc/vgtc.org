The IEEE Large Scale Data Analysis and Visualization (LDAV) symposium targets methodological innovation, algorithmic foundations, and possible end-to-end solutions. The LDAV symposium brings together domain scientists, data analysts, visualization researchers, and users to foster common ground for solving both near- and long-term problems. Topic emphasis is on algorithms, languages, systems, and/or hardware solutions that support the collection, analysis, manipulation, or visualization of large-scale data.
