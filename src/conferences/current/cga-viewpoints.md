Visualization Viewpoints articles offer detailed technical opinions on trends in visualization or reports on how visualization has contributed to the comprehension of data. We encourage discussions of challenges or limitations in today's methods and areas of potential new topics of research. We are also interested in application discussions that focus on the physical, life or social sciences, engineering, or commerce, for example, or related to the process of visualization in general. We strongly encourage an emphasis on lessons learned from practical experience for application discussions, particularly where visualization has been employed in a real, working environment.
