      <h3>Preface</h3><p><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Welcome to the </span><a href="http://3dui.org/2014/" style="line-height: 1.538em;" target="_blank">IEEE Symposium on 3D User Interfaces 2014</a><span style="line-height: 1.538em;"> (IEEE 3DUI 2014), taking place in Minneapolis, Minnesota, on March 29th-30th, 2014.</span></p><div>The symposium is co-located with <a href="http://ieeevr.org/2014/" target="_blank">IEEE Virtual Reality 2014</a>. IEEE 3DUI 2014 is the ninth international symposium focused on the topic of three-dimensional user interfaces. Although a recent area of research, 3DUI is already a very well established topic and rapidly expanding.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This area has emerged from many different disciplines, including virtual, augmented, and mixed reality, human-computer interaction, computer graphics, cognitive and perceptual psychology, and 3D games.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This year, the program chairs received 72 submissions (50 long papers and 22 technotes) in all areas of 3DUI. Each submission was reviewed in a double-blind way by at least two reviewers from the international program committee and two external reviewers.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>The primary reviewers additionally provided meta-reviews and recommendations after a discussion phase among the expert reviewers. The program chairs accepted 10 long papers and 6 technotes, which corresponds to an acceptance rate of 20% for long papers and 27% for technotes. In addition, 5 long papers were accepted as technotes, which results in an overall acceptance rate of 29%.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>These papers cover a wide range of topics in 3D user interfaces from: 3D selection and manipulation in desktop-based environments, navigation in virtual environments, haptics and touch interaction, perception and calibration, and 3DUI systems and applications.</div><div>The proceedings also include two-page papers for each of the 28 posters presented during the symposium.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We are pleased to welcome <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/awilson/" target="_blank">Andy Wilson</a>, Principal Researcher at Microsoft Research, as the keynote speaker this year. Andy&#39;s work is focused on applying sensing techniques to enable new styles of human-computer interaction, for instance by using multi-touch and gesture-based interfaces, display technologies, depth cameras and so-called &quot;natural&quot; interfaces. In his talk, Andy will discuss a number of interactive spatial augmented reality prototypes he has worked on over the years, and some of the deeper challenges these systems highlight involving interaction</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>This year, 3DUI also hosts for the fifth time the 3DUI contest, the 3DUI Grand Prize, where teams compete to demonstrate the efficiency of the interaction techniques they have imagined to complete a 3D annotation task of point-could data sets. We received five submissions to the contest, which are included as two-page presentations in the proceedings. All of contest participants will present their setups in live demonstrations.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We would like to thank all people who made IEEE 3DUI 2014 possible. Special thanks go to the program committee members who donated their time to ensure a fair selection process in a very short review period. Additional thanks go to the external reviewers for their insightful and thorough reviews.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We also want to thank Torsten Kuhlen, Jürgen Schulze, Amy Ulinski Banic, who greatly managed the poster submissions process, and the 3DUI contest chairs Robert Teather, Sharif Razzaque, Jason Jerald, Gerd Bruder who handled the hard job of managing the 3DUI contest. Similarly, we thank the web chair Ferran Argelaguet Sanz for designing and maintaining the 3DUI 2014 website, Pablo Figueroa and Christian Sandor for being 3DUI 2014 publication and awards chairs, and Sabarish Babu, Ferran Argelaguet Sanz and Kouta Minamizawa for being 3DUI 2014 publicity chairs. Many thanks to Meghan Haley for managing the proceedings process.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>We also acknowledge the support of IEEE, the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC), as well as the IEEE 3DUI Steering Committee. Most of the organization of IEEE 3DUI as well as local arrangement is shared with IEEE VR. We are therefore grateful to the IEEE VR organizing committee for taking care of the organization of IEEE 3DUI 2014. In particular, we would like to thank Victoria Interrante and Daniel Keefe for their very helpful support and their guidance to ensure that we will have a great 3DUI symposium this year.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Finally, we thank all the authors for their excellent submissions, without which this symposium could not exist. We hope that this symposium will continue to connect researchers from all backgrounds of 3D user interface research and be enjoyable, interesting and stimulating for the participants.</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div>Please enjoy the 3DUI 2014 Symposium!</div><div>&nbsp;</div><div><em>3DUI 2014 Program Chairs</em></div><div><a href="http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Anatole.Lecuyer/" target="_blank">Anatole Lécuyer</a>, <em>INRIA, France</em></div><div><a href="http://web.cs.wpi.edu/~gogo/" target="_blank">Rob Lindeman</a>, <em>Worcester Polytechnic Institute, USA</em></div><div><a href="http://www.inf.uni-hamburg.de/en/inst/ab/hci/people/steinicke.html" target="_blank">Frank Steinicke</a>, <em>University of Würzburg, Germany</em></div>    </div>
