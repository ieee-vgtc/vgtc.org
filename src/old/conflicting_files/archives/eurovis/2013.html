      <h3><span style="line-height: 1.538em;">Preface</span></h3><p><a href="http://www.eurovis2013.de" target="_blank">EuroVis 2013</a>, the 15th Eurographics Conference on Visualization, was held on June 17-21, 2013, in Leipzig, Germany. The decision of the DataVis steering committee to select Leipzig as host of the Euro- Vis is largely based on the initiative of <a href="https://www.eg.org/index.php/news/general-news/113-in-memoriam-of-dirk-bartz" target="_blank">Dirk Bartz</a>, who was professor for computer-assisted surgery and a pioneer in medical visualization at that time. After his tragic passing in 2010, the steering committee stuck to this decision and the event also serves to remember Dirk.</p><p>The proceedings are published as a special issue of the Eurographics Computer Graphics Forum jour- nal. The conference, which started in 1990 as the Eurographics Workshop on Visualization in Scientific Computing and was called VisSym after 1999, has been known as EuroVis since 2005. EuroVis attracts contributions that broadly cover the field of visualization. Topics include visualization techniques for spatial data, such as volumetric, tensor, and vector field datasets, and for non-spatial data, such as graphs, text, and high-dimensional datasets. EuroVis also covers the theory of visualization, hardware accelera- tion, large datasets, perception, interaction, user studies, visual analytics, and many application areas of visualization.</p><p>After the submission deadline in early December 2012, 177 manuscripts were reviewed in a two-stage process that resulted in 49 accepted papers and an acceptance rate of 27.7%. During the first review cycle, each paper was reviewed by at least four reviewers. The primary and secondary reviewers were members of the International Program Committee (IPC) and each selected at least one additional tertiary reviewer from outside the IPC. The IPC meanwhile represents the global visualization community quite well. As an example, three IPC members are from Brazil, two from India, three more from Asia (China, South Korea, and Japan). Of course, a large portion (21) of the IPC is from the US. The IPC at EuroVis is a rather dynamic committee with regular rotations after a three-year period.</p><p>The review process was double-blind for tertiary reviewers: only the members of the IPC and the chairs knew the identity of the authors. A great effort was made to identify and prevent conflicts of interest at all levels, and all reviewers were asked to read and agree to the IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC) ethics guidelines.</p><p>After all the reviews were completed, the primary reviewer led an online discussion among all reviewers and was responsible for writing a summary review and recommendation. These discussions were lively, sometimes with more than ten entries in the discussion board and thus often significantly helping to find a consensus. In some cases, the paper co-chairs requested additional feedback from well-distinguished experts in the field. Based on the reviewers&rsquo; recommendations, the individual reviews, the online dis- cussions, and after a thorough deliberation by the chairs, 49 papers were conditionally accepted. Five additional papers were deemed to have substantial potential after major revisions, and were invited for a fast-track review process to Computer Graphics Forum for possible publication in a future issue. In the second review cycle, the revised papers were again carefully reviewed by the primary reviewers, and due to the significant improvements all 49 were finally accepted for publication. We are thankful to everybody who helped to make the event possible. In particular, we thank our invited speakers <a href="http://www.zib.de/hege/" target="_blank">Hans-Christian Hege</a> and <a href="http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/~studla/" target="_blank">Peter Stadler</a>. Furthermore, we thank Karin Wenzel, Mario Hlawitschka, Stefan Koch, and Steven Schlegel from the University of Leipzig for organizational support.</p><p>We thank the IPC members for their careful and timely work in all stages of the reviewing process and also the tertiary reviewers for providing in-depth assessments of the submissions. We helped to shape the reviews to be as constructive as possible to also provide the authors of rejected papers with substantial feedback for their further research.</p><p>We thank the chairs of the short paper track, Mario Hlawitschka and Tino Weinkauf, for their great efforts. We also thank the chairs of the co-located workshops: Olaf Kolditz, Gerik Scheuermann, Karsten Rink, Robert S. Laramee, Mike Kirby, Paul Rosenthal, Margit Pohl, Heidrun Schumann, Michael Aupetit, Laurens van der Maaten, Lars Linsen, Hans-Christian Hege, and Bernd Hamann. We deeply appreciate the hard work of the members of the IPC and the many tertiary reviewers. We thank Tom Ertl, Jarke van Wijk, Alark Joshi, and Melanie Tory for giving us additional feedback on some borderline papers. We thank Petra Specht for having big parts of the paper organization in her hands. We thank James Stewart for his support of the Precision Conference System (PCS) that was used for the entire submission and reviewing process. We also thank Stefanie Behnke, who handled the publication of this journal with professionalism and patience. We thank the authors of all submitted papers and all conference attendees.</p><div>Finally, we thank our supporters and sponsors for their important financial contributions: the KAUST, DFG, IBM, IRTG 1131, NVIDIA, OReilly, UFZ, AMS, Springer, Fraunhofer IGD, University of Leipzig. We hope that you enjoy reading this collection of high-quality visualization papers.</div><div><a href="http://www.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/bsv/homepage/en/people/gerik-scheuermann" target="_blank">Gerik Scheuermann</a> <em>(Conference Chair)</em></div><div><a href="http://isgwww.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/~bernhard/" target="_blank">Bernhard Preim</a>, <a href="http://www.csee.umbc.edu/~rheingan/" target="_blank">Penny Rheingans</a>, <a href="http://wwwisg.cs.uni-magdeburg.de/isg/theisel.html" target="_blank">Holger Theisel</a> <em>(Paper Co-Chairs)</em></div>    </div>
