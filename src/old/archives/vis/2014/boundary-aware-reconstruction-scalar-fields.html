In this paper we propose a novel approach that improves classification of different materials and their boundaries by combining information from the classifiers at the reconstruction stage. Our approach estimates the targeted materials??? local support before performing multiple material-specific reconstructions that prevent much of the misclassification traditionally associated with transitional regions and transfer function (TF) design. With respect to previously published methods our approach offers a number of improvements and advantages. For one, it does not rely on TFs acting on derivative expressions, therefore it is less sensitive to noisy data and the classification of a single material does not depend on specialized TF widgets or specifying regions in a multidimensional TF . Additionally, improved classification is attained without increasing TF dimensionality, which promotes scalability to multivariate data. These aspects are also key in maintaining low interaction complexity. The results are simple-to-achieve visualizations that better comply with the user???s understanding of discrete features within the studied object.<div class="field field-name-field-vimeo field-type-video-embed-field field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Conference presentation:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">
