In this paper, we present a novel approach that can be seen as a generalization of Multiplanar Reformation to curved surfaces. The main concept is to generate reformatted medical volumes driven by the individual anatomical geometry of a specific patient. This allows to provide flat views of anatomical structures that facilitate many tasks such as diagnosis, navigation and annotation. Our reformation framework is based on a non-linear as-rigid-as-possible volumetric deformation scheme that uses generic triangular surface meshes as input. To manage inevitable distortions during reformation, we introduce importance maps which allow to control error distribution and to improve the overall visual quality in areas of elevated interest. Our method seamlessly integrates with well-established concepts such as the slice-based inspection of medical datasets and we believe it can \ improve the overall efficiency of many medical workflows. To demonstrate this, we additionally present an integrated visualization system and discuss several use cases that substantiate its benefits.<div class="field field-name-field-vimeo field-type-video-embed-field field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Conference presentation:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">
