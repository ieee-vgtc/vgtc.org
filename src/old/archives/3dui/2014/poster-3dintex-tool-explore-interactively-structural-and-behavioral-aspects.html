The tool accepts a CAD model of the system and other data sets that describe the system safety behavioral aspects. 3DintEx was built using the Vrui framework [6], which makes it portable and scalable on a range of VR environments (e.g., desktop 3D displays, PowerWall, or CAVE). 3DintEx extends the Vrui framework in order to provide options that ease up the interactive exploration of the CAD model. Moreover, it was designed to link the available input devices to 3D interaction facilities for extracting more information from the system 3D model.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Fposter-3dintex-tool-explore-interactively-structural-and-behavioral-aspects">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
