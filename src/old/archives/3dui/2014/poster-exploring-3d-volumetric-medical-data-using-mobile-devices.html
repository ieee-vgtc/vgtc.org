To replace traditional techniques, using mobile devices present an effective means for navigating and exploring complex 3D medical data sets, as they provide increased fluidity and flexibility, leveraging people's existing skills with tangible objects. 3D interactions using mobile devices may provide benefit for imaging specialists, but little is known about using these interactions in the medical imaging domain. In this paper, we explore the design of 3D interaction techniques using mobile devices and preliminary feedback from imaging specialists suggests that these interactions may be a viable solution for the medical imaging domain.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Fposter-exploring-3d-volumetric-medical-data-using-mobile-devices">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
