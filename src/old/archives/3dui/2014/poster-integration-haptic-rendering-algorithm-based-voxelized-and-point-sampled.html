Our algorithm uses voxelized distance fields and multi-resolution point-sampled representations and it is able to compute collision forces between arbitrary complex bodies at 1 kHz. Current experiments show that the integrated algorithm outperforms standard collision detection engines in Bullet in terms of speed if high resolutions and accuracies are required, enabling physically more realistic behaviors.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Fposter-integration-haptic-rendering-algorithm-based-voxelized-and-point-sampled">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
