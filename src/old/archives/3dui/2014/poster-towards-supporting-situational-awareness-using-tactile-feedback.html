A head-mounted interface has been developed where tactile feedback can be presented to alert the user to important situational events, such as the presence of spatial obstacles. Our research aims to examine ways in which cues can be developed to support levels of situational awareness for decision-making. Early results from our work suggest that the participatory approach adopted offers considerable potential when developing feedback for presentation to sites on the body which are rarely used for tactile interaction (e.g. locations on the head).<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Fposter-towards-supporting-situational-awareness-using-tactile-feedback">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
