To cope with that, reorientation techniques can be used to redirect users away from physical boundaries. However, existing reorientation techniques typically actively interrupt the user, or depend on the application of rotation gain that can lead to simulator sickness. In our approach, reorientation is performed using portals. Users can choose the desired target interactively, and are reoriented by physically walking through the portal. We show that the method does not cause additional simulator sickness, and participants walk more than with point-and-fly navigation or teleportation.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Freorientation-virtual-environments-using-interactive-portals">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
