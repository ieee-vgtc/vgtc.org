I will present a number of interactive spatial augmented reality systems that leverage depth cameras and projection technologies to create immersive interactive experiences. While these prototypes are fun explorations in form factor and interaction, many get at deeper issues related to making our so called "natural" interfaces useful, usable and computable. The prospect of spatial augmented reality is exciting, but it seems we have a lot of work ahead of us!<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Finteracting-spatial-augmented-realityy">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
