Accordingly, demand of 3D modeling for ordinary people has been increased. In case of using existed hand-held 3D scanning system, users have to estimate unmeasured spots to decide route for scanning and terminate scanning by watching a process of scanning iteratively. These many user operations impose burdens to users. In this paper, we propose a novel scanning system which provides route guidance by means of area limitation of scanning at the beginning. We conduct experiment to investigate required time, and mental effort for scanning with applying proposed area limitation. As a result, our proposed method can realize 3D scanning with low burden effectively, easily and quickly.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Fposter-automatic-termination-and-route-guide-3d-scanning-based-area-limitation">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
