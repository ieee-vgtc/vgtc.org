If such calibrations involve user interactions, they are time-consuming and inject user-dependent errors, thereby distracting users from their applications. Our proposed calibration utilizes dynamic 3D eye position measurements from an eye tracker in combination with pre-computed, static display parameters. We compare our calibration with SPAAM (Single Point Active Alignment Method) for several head-display conditions. The result shows that our eye tracking-based calibration is more stable than repeated SPAAM calibrations. We also discuss potential error sources.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Finteraction-free-calibration-optical-see-through-head-mounted-displays-based-3d">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
