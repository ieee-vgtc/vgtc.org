The system focuses on three types of disabilities: autism spectrum disorder, traumatic brain injury, and severe mobility impairment. The system allows job trainers to rapidly assess the capabilities of individuals with disabilities, detect the most suitable job for them, and train them in a safe and motivating environment where there are no significant consequences of making errors. Design considerations and research questions that arise throughout development are shared to create awareness of the special considerations involved in developing virtual reality systems for individuals with disabilities.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Fposter-design-and-development-virtual-reality-system-vocational-rehabilitation">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
