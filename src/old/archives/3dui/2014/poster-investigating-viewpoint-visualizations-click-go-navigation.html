These scenarios often occur in 3D navigation systems that are based on sets of photos and possibly an underlying 3D reconstruction. Given these photos (and the 3D reconstruction), how does one most effectively navigate through this environment? Existing systems often employ Click & Go interfaces which allow users to navigate with one click of the mouse or tap of the finger. In this work, we investigate viewpoint visualizations for such Click & Go interfaces, describing a preliminary user study and providing valuable insights into Click & Go and its viewpoint visualizations.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Fposter-investigating-viewpoint-visualizations-click-go-navigation">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
