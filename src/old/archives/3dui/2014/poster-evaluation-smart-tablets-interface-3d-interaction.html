More specifically, we focused on a 3D docking task. This collaborative project was conducted within the Visionair European project. The goal was to design a versatile interface that was independent of the targeted VR system (from 2D screens to CAVE-like systems). We investigated the usability of tactile (i.e. finger-controlled) tablets that are omnipresent in our daily life, assumed to have intuitive control characteristics and easily connected to a VR system (via WIFI connections). Participants' performance was evaluated when using a tablet, as compared to a classical mouse interface. Results indicated comparable learning effects (with task repetition) for both devices, but a clear advantage of the tablet's interface, as concerns the simultaneous use of multiple degrees of freedom of motion of the manipulated object.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2F3dui%2F2014%2Fposter-evaluation-smart-tablets-interface-3d-interaction">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
