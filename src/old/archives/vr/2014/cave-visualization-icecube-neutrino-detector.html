IceCube, located at the South Pole, is the largest operating neutrino detector in the world. This paper presents a VR application for visualization of IceCube's data within a C6 CAVE system. The visualization of data in a true scale recreation of the detection system allows viewing of events from arbitrary locations both forward and backward in time. Initial application feedback has been positive, showing promise for both further insight into analyzing data as well as opportunities for physics and neutrino education.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fcave-visualization-icecube-neutrino-detector">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
