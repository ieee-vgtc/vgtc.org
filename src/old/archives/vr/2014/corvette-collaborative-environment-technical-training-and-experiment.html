The CORVETTE project aims at producing significant innovations in the field of collaborative virtual training. For that purpose, CORVETTE combines various technologies to enhance the effective collaboration between users and virtual humans performing a common task. First, CORVETTE proposes a model of collaborative interaction in virtual environments allowing actors to efficiently collaborate as a team whether they are controlled by a user or by a virtual human [4]. Moreover, the environment is simulated in real-time, at real scale and is using physics as well as physically-based humanoids to improve the realism of the training. Second, thanks to the interaction model, we defined a protocol of exchange of avatars [5, 3, 2]. Thus, an actor can dynamically exchange the control of his/her avatar with the one controlled by another user or by a virtual agent. Moreover, to improve the exchange protocol, we designed a new knowledge model embedded in each avatar. It allows users and virtual humans to retrieve knowledge previously gathered by an avatar following an exchange. The preservation of knowledge is indeed especially crucial for teamwork. Finally, we handle verbal communication between users and virtual humans with speech recognition and synthesis. Actors' knowledge is enhanced through dialogue and used for decision-making and conversation [1].<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fcorvette-collaborative-environment-technical-training-and-experiment">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
