Participants performed a simple lifting task both physically using an actual weight and virtually by monitoring surface EMG. While the participants subjectively indicated that their effort was the same for each of these presentation methods, we found significant differences in the muscle activity between the two virtual presentation methods. For all primary mover muscle groups and weights, the more immersive virtual presentation method led to exertions that were much more approximate to the exertions used for the physical weights.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fassessing-exertions-how-increased-level-immersion-unwittingly-leads-more-natural">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
