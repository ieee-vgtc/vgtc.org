Input devices at the laboratory are an Xbox 360 game pad and an air mouse. We wanted to test if there was a benefit from upgrading to a 6-DOF tracking system. Thus, we conducted a pilot study for three tasks (selection, navigation, and maneuvering) and three devices (gamepad, air mouse, 6-DOF wand). Results indicate that the wand allows users to complete tasks faster and is preferred by users. However, in certain situations its use led to more errors.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fcomparative-study-input-devices-vr-mine-simulation">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
