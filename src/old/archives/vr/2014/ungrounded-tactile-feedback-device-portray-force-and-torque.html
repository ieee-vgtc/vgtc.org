Interaction with a virtual environment is provided to a user through a device equipped with tactile feedback and six degree-of-freedom spatial position sensing. Our tactile feedback device is composed of three sliding plate skin stretch displays positioned around the handle, providing feedback to a user?s palm. Our dual-handed tactile feedback system allows independent motion of hands, while providing feedback that creates a kinesthetic experience. We demonstrate fundamental physical interactions such as mass, spring, and damper interactions, which are the building blocks used in every virtual model. Various virtual environments are used to demonstrate physical interactions with objects.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fungrounded-tactile-feedback-device-portray-force-and-torque">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
