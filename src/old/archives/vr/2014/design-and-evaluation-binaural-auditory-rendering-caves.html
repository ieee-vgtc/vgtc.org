In our experiment, participants had to physically walk along a virtual path exposed to different auditory stimuli. Each subject was exposed to three conditions: Stereo, Binaural sound spatially congruent with visual and binaural sound spatially incongruent with visuals and had to rate subjectively each. The results of the experiment showed increased preference ratings for the binaural audio rendering, followed by stereo rendering. As expected incongruent spatial cues were ranked significantly lower. <div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fdesign-and-evaluation-binaural-auditory-rendering-caves">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
