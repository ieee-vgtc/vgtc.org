With this experiment we analyse how user attention is diverted while walking in VE when audio and/or visual attractors are present. Auditory feedback was delivered through binaural audio. The CAVE used for the experiment allowed users to walk up to 9m in straight line. \ Different ???attractors??ï¿½ were proposed (audio and/or visual, static or dynamic). Results show that audio-visual attractors are the most efficient in order to keep the user???s attention toward the inside of CAVE.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Faudio-visual-attractors-capturing-attention-screens-when-walking-cave-systems">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
