It has previously been demonstrated that different types of feedback may be used to constrain the movement of the user. This poster presents a within-subjects study comparing four methods for ensuring that the user remains within a certain area. The results indicate that passive haptic feedback (a carpet) was preferred and also was regarded as the most helpful and the least intrusive. However, gathered qualitative data suggest that this method might be used in combination with feedback in other modalities.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fcomparison-four-different-approaches-reducing-unintended-positional-drift-during">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
