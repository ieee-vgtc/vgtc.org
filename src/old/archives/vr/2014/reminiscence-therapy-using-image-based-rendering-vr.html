The solution consists in an immersive VR system designed for RT, which allows easy presentation of familiar environments. The system supports highly-realistic Image-based rendering in an immersive setting.  A study with healthy elderly participants is performed to test if the VR system can help with the generation of autobiographical memories. The verbal Autobiographical Fluency protocol is adapted to the VR context, and a comparison of the use of image-based system for an unknown and a familiar environment is performed.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Freminiscence-therapy-using-image-based-rendering-vr">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
