However, creation of a single virtual patient scenario may take six months or more, so it is difficult to provide many unique scenarios during the course of a nurse's education. In this work, I propose the user-centered design, creation, and evaluation of a scenario-builder tool to enable nursing faculty to create their own scenarios, reducing development costs.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fdevelopment-scenario-builder-tool-scaffolded-virtual-patients">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
