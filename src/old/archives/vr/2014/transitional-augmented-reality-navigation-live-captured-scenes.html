However, instead of using previously recorded and prepared scenes, users must interact with an unprepared environment. We present a set of new interaction techniques that support users in handling captured real world environments. The techniques present virtual viewpoints of the scene based on a scene analysis and provide natural transitions between the AR view and virtual viewpoints. We demonstrate our approach with a SLAM based prototype.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Ftransitional-augmented-reality-navigation-live-captured-scenes">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
