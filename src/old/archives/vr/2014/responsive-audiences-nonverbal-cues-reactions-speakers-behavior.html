One way to learn such skills is to use virtual audiences (VA) that simulate the reactions of a live public. A study was conducted to conceptualize the design of such a VA. It was inquired how the nonverbal cues of live audiences vary depending on a speaker???s gaze patterns and vocal loudness. 36 students (listeners) were videotaped during a public speaking situation. The analysis showed that the speaker???s gaze patterns and vocal loudness influenced gaze patterns and body postures of audience members.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fresponsive-audiences-nonverbal-cues-reactions-speakers-behavior">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
