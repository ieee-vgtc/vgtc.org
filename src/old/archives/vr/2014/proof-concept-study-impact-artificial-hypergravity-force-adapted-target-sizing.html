Therefore an adequate countermeasure is required. This paper presents the results of a proof-of-concept study to investigate the impact of simulated hypergravity on target???s size and distance. The study was divided in two experiments, whereby hypergravity was induced by a long-arm human centrifuge and by weights attached to subjects??? dominant arm. The study showed that at higher gravity levels larger target size and larger distance between the targets led to increased performance.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fproof-concept-study-impact-artificial-hypergravity-force-adapted-target-sizing">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
