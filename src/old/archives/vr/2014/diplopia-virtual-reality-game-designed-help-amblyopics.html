More than 3% of the population have amblyopia, commonly known as lazy eye, a weakness and impairment of vision in one or both of the eyes [1]. Amblyopia often results in a suppression of the information coming from the bad eye, and a loss of stereoscopic vision as a result. It was long thought that people with amblyopia could not improve the vision in their bad eye or gain stereoscopic vision after a critical age of 10-12 years old. Recent research indicates the adult brain is more plastic with regards to suppressiion than previously thought. [2]. Inspired by this, we have built a virtual reality game, called Diplopia, using Unity3D which utilizes the Oculus Rift head-mounted display (HMD) and the Leap Motion controller to help people with amblyopia restore vision in their amblyopic eye.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fdiplopia-virtual-reality-game-designed-help-amblyopics">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
