Recently, image processing and hardware advances are allowing the development of applications that allow an user to preview different types of environments according to the user measurements. This project proposes the development of a complimentary tool for acquiring user anthropometric data for characterizing users in the Mil. Nueva Granada University in Colombia, South America using Microsoft???s Kinect skeletal tracking for developing and assess the design of workspaces in several areas such as laboratories.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fdevelopment-kinect-based-anthropometric-measurement-application">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
