Handling such a wide FoV implies the use of non-planar projections and generates specific problems such as for rasterization and clipping. We propose a novel pre-clip stage specifically adapted to geometric approaches for which problems occur with polygons spanning across the projection discontinuities. Our approach integrates seamlessly with immersive virtual reality systems. Thus, our geometric approach could be used in various VR applications in which the user needs to extend the FoV and apprehend more visual information.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fstereoscopic-rendering-virtual-environments-wide-field-views-360">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
