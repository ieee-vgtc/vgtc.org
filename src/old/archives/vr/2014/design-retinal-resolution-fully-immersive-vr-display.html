With 1 arc-minute resolution, 3.8 pi steradians of visual surround, head-tracked stereo, and an almost seamless screen, this Cave offers an upgrade to the state-of-the-art virtual reality experience. We achieve this with, notably, 69 high-resolution long throw projectors, a cylindrical screen with conical ceiling, and a 135 square feet rear-projection floor. Caves have thus far remained impractical for many potential uses due to their limited resolution, brightness, and overall immersion. Brown's new Cave attempts to bridge this gap.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fdesign-retinal-resolution-fully-immersive-vr-display">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
