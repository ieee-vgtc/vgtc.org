Our experiment was based on replicating a similar experiment conducted by Edwards et al. [2]. We used an AR haploscope [1], which allows us to independently manipulate accommodative demand and vergence angle of the visible image. Fifteen observers matched the perceived depth of an AR-presented virtual object with a physical pointer. Overall, observers overestimated depth by 5 mm or less in the presence of the occluder, while in the absence of an occluder they overestimated depth by 5 to 10 mm. The data from Edwards et al. [2] is normalized, and when we performed the same normalization procedure on our own data, our results do not agree with Edwards et al. [2]. We suspect that eye vergence explains these results.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Feffect-occluder-near-field-depth-matching-optical-see-through-augmented-reality">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
