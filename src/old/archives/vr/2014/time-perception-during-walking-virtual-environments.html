So far, no empirical data has been collected for time misperception in immersive VEs to our knowledge. However, there is evidence that time perception can deviate from veridical judgments, for instance, due to visual or auditive stimulation related to motion misperception. In this work we evaluate time perception during walking with a pilot study in a head-mounted display environment. Significant differences between time judgments in the real and virtual environment could not be observed.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Ftime-perception-during-walking-virtual-environments">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
