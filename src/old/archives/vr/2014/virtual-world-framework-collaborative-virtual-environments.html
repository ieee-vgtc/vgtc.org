Web applications are often a good solution because users can instantly receive application updates on any device without needing special permissions to install them on their hardware. Until recently, it was not possible to create 3D multiuser virtual environment-based web applications that didn?t require installing a browser plugin. However, recent web standards have made it possible. We present the Virtual World Framework (VWF), a software framework for creating 3D multiuser web applications. We are using VWF to create applications for team training and collaboration. VWF can be downloaded at http://virtual.wf.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fvirtual-world-framework-collaborative-virtual-environments">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
