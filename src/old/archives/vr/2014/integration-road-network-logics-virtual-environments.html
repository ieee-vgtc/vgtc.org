The work presented here introduces an universal and extensible model for the representation of road network logics. Additionally, setup processes of road network logics following the model are described, and the integration of different traffic simulation approaches is discussed. For evaluation, scenes according to different scenarios were created and semantics were integrated. Results indicate significant time savings from automatic generation of road network logics.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fintegration-road-network-logics-virtual-environments">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
