Its implementation requires great skills and knowledge from a health care specialist. Advances in patient simulators present solutions regarding children and adults, however, newborn simulators are scarce. \  \ This paper presents the development of a newborn's central venous access simulator for training and educational purposes. The simulation system is composed of three main subsystems: a procedural simulation, showing how the procedure must be correctly performed; a haptic subsystem for increasing realism; and finally a newborn manikin with image projection for guiding the procedure. \ <div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Fvr-central-venous-access-simulation-system-newborns">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
