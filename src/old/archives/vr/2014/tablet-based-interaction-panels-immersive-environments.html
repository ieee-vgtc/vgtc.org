Leveraging rapid prototyping techniques, we have designed and manufactured a variety of panels that can be overlaid on multi-touch tablets and smartphones. The panels are coupled with an app running on the multi-touch device that exchanges commands and state information over a wireless network with the virtual reality application. Sculpted features of the templates provide tactile disambiguation of control widgets and an onscreen head up display provides interaction state information. <div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Ftablet-based-interaction-panels-immersive-environments">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
