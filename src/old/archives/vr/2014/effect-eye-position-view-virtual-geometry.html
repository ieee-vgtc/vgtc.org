We test a range of reasonable eye positions and interpupillary distances. It was observed that geometric distortions introduced by the display???s optical system changes substantially as the eye moves from one position to the next. These visual displacements can be on the order of several degrees and increase in magnitude towards the peripheral edges of the field of view. Though many systems calibrate for interpupillary distance and optical distortions separately, this may be insufficient as eye position influences distortion characteristics.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fvr%2F2014%2Feffect-eye-position-view-virtual-geometry">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
