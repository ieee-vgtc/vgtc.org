This creates the dual-view problem a consequence of virtual transparency which does not match true transparency - what the user would see looking through a transparent glass pane. The dual-view problem affects usability of handheld AR systems and is commonly addressed though user-perspective rendering solutions. Whilst such approach produces promising results, the complexity of implementing user-perspective rendering and the fact it does not solve all sources that produce the dual-view problem, means it only ever addresses part of the problem. This paper seeks to create a more complete solution for the dual-view problem that will be applicable to readily available handheld-device. We pursue this goal by designing, implementing and evaluating a novel interaction paradigm we call `contact-view'. By utilizing the back and front-facing camera and the environment base-plane texture - predefined or incrementally created on the fly, we enable placing the device directly on top of the base-plane. As long as the position of the phone in relation to the base-plane is known, appropriate segment of the occluded base-plane can be rendered on the device screen, result of which is transparency in which dual-view problem is eliminated.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-contact-view-magic-lens-paradigm-designed-solve-dual-view-problem">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
