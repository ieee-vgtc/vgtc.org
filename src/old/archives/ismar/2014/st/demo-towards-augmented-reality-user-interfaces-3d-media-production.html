A user wears a head-mounted display (HMD) and thin cotton gloves which allow him to interact with virtual 3D models in the work area. Additional viewers can see the video stream on a projector and thus share the users view. Both head and hand positions are tracked from the HMD video stream, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and conductive materials on the gloves allow interaction with virtual objects. This system is built using Autodesk Maya ﾗ a professional 3D software package commonly used in the media industry ﾗ and aims to fulfill the requirements of professional 3D design work which we identified in our paper of the same title. While still an early prototype, it was already tested with media professionals to evaluate our approach.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fdemo-towards-augmented-reality-user-interfaces-3d-media-production">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
