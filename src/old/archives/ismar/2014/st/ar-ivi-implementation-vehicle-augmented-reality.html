In October 2013, Mercedes-Benz exhibited to a public audience the AR In-Vehicle Infotainment (AR-IVI) system aimed at defining an overall in-vehicle electric/electronic (E/E) architecture for augmented reality rather than showing specific use cases. In this paper, we explain the requirements and design decisions that lead to the system-design, and we share the challenges and experiences in developing the AR-IVI system in the prototype vehicle. Based on our experiences, we give an outlook on future software and E/E architectural challenges of in-vehicle augmented reality.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Far-ivi-implementation-vehicle-augmented-reality">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
