The novelty of the system lies in the fact that users can see and use their real hands - by means of a Kinect-like camera mounted on the HMD - in order to naturally interact with the virtual objects. Our working hypothesis are that the introduction of the photorealistic capture of users' hands in a coherently rendered virtual scenario induces in them a strong feeling of presence and embodiment without the need of using a synthetic 3D modelled avatar as a representation of the self. We also argue that the users' ability of grasping and manipulating virtual objects using their own hands not only provides an intuitive interaction experience, but also improves self-perception as well as the perception of the environment.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-interacting-your-own-hands-fully-immersive-mr-system">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
