The system uses an optical see-through HMD, and thus requires extremely low latency, high tracking accuracy and precision alignment and calibration of all subsystems in order to avoid mis-registration and ﾓswimﾔ. The paper focuses on the optical/inertial hybrid tracking system and describes novel solutions to the challenges with the optics, algorithms, synchronization, and alignment with the vehicle and HMD systems. A system accuracy analysis is presented with simulation results to predict the registration accuracy. Finally, a car test is used to create a through-the-eyepiece video demonstrating well-registered augmentations of the road and nearby structures while driving.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fimproved-registration-vehicular-ar-using-auto-harmonization">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
