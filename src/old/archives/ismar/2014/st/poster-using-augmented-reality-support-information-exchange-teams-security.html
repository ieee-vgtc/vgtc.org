This extended abstract investigates the potential of augmented reality (AR) techniques to facilitate information exchange and situational awareness of teams from the security domain. First, different scenarios from the security domain that have been elicited using an end-user oriented design approach are described. Second, a usability study is briefly presented based on an experiment with experts from operational security units. The results of the study show that the scenarios are well-defined and the AR environment can successfully support information exchange in teams operating in the security domain.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-using-augmented-reality-support-information-exchange-teams-security">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
