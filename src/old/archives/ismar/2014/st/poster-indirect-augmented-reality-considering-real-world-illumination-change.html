Meanwhile, IAR causes inconsistency between the real world and the pre-captured image. This paper describes the first-ever study focusing on the temporal inconsistency issue in IAR. We propose a novel IAR system which reflects real-world illumination change by selecting an appropriate image from a set of images pre-captured under various illumination. Results of a public experiment show that the proposed system can improve the realism in IAR.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-indirect-augmented-reality-considering-real-world-illumination-change">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
