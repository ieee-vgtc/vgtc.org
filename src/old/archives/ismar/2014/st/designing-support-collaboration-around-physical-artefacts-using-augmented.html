To explore the research question in the project, a Research through Design approach has been adopted. A technology probe — an evolutionary prototype of a remote collaboration system — will be used to fuel the research. The prototype will facilitate collaboration between small groups around physical artefacts in an augmented learning environment. The prototype will inform future collaborative augmented reality technology design.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fdesigning-support-collaboration-around-physical-artefacts-using-augmented">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
