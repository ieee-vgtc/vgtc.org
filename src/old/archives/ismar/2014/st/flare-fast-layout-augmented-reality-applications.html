We propose a rule-based framework for generating object layouts for AR applications. Under our framework, the developer of an AR application specifies a set of rules (constraints) which enforce self-consistency (rules regarding the inter-relationships of application components) and scene-consistency (application components are consistent with the physical environment they are placed in). When a user enters a new environment, we create, in real-time, a layout for the application, which is consistent with the defined constraints (as much as possible). We find the optimal configurations for each object by solving a constraint-satisfaction problem. Our stochastic move making algorithm is domain-aware, and allows us to efficiently converge to a solution for most rule-sets. In the paper we demonstrate several augmented reality applications that automatically adapt to different rooms and changing circumstances in each room.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fflare-fast-layout-augmented-reality-applications">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
