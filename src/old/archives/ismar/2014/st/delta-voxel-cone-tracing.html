In this paper we present a novel relighting solution called Delta Voxel Cone Tracing to compute both direct shadows and first bounce mutual indirect illumination. We introduce a voxelized, pre-filtered representation of the combined real and synthetic surfaces together with the extracted illumination difference due to the augmentation. In a final gathering step this representation is cone-traced and superimposed onto both types of surfaces, adding additional light from indirect bounces and synthetic shadows from anti-radiance present in the volume. The algorithm computes results at interactive rates, is temporally coherent and to our knowledge provides the first real-time rasterizer solution for mutual diffuse, glossy and perfect specular indirect reflections between synthetic and real surfaces in mixed reality.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fdelta-voxel-cone-tracing">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
