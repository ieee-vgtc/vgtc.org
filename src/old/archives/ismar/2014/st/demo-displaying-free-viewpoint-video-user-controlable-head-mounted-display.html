The free-viewpoint video is generated by multiple 4K resolution cameras in sport games such as soccer and american football. This method can provide us a player's perspective. We adopt a billboard method to make a free-viewpoint video which is consisted of multiple textures accoding to user specified viewpoint. For implementing the program and displaying images effectively we used a game development system, a HMD and a game controller that user can operate their own views in the high degree of freedom. Experiment results show that the proposed method can obviously achive effective view.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fdemo-displaying-free-viewpoint-video-user-controlable-head-mounted-display">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
