A new calibration technique is introduced for calibrating every single display pixel of the STGs in order to overcome the disadvantages of a parametric model. A non-parametric model compared to the parametric one has the advantage that it can also map arbitrary distortions. The new generation of STGs using waveguide-based displays [5] will have higher arbitrary distortions due to the characteristics of their optics. First tests show better accuracies than in previous works. By using cameras which are placed behind the displays of the STGs, no error prone user interaction is necessary. It is shown that a high accuracy tracking device is not necessary for a good calibration. A camera mounted rigidly on the STGs is used to find the relations between the system components. Furthermore, this work elaborates on the necessity of a second subsequent calibration step which adapts the STGs to a specific user. First tests prove the theory that this subsequent step is necessary.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-non-parametric-camera-based-calibration-optical-see-through-glasses">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
