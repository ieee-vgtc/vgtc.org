Contrary to our other senses the eyes not only perceive but also provide information to a keen observer. However, thus far this has been mainly used to detect reflection of infrared light sources to estimate the user's gaze. The reflection of the visible spectrum on the other hand has rarely been utilized. In this dissertation we want to explore how the analysis of the corneal image can improve currently available eye-related solutions, such as calibration of optical see-through head-mounted devices or eye-gaze tracking and point of regard estimation in arbitrary environments. We also aim to study how corneal imaging can become an alternative for established augmented reality tasks such as tracking and localization.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fcorneal-imaging-localization-and-hmd-interaction">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
