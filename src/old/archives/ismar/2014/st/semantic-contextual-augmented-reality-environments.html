The first element is the user's context (preferences, privileges, location, time, device's capabilities). The second element is a set of trackables â€” visual markers representing real world objects that can be augmented for a given user in a given context. The third element are content objects, representing interactive 2D and 3D multimedia content including video sequences and sounds to be presented on the trackables. The last one is a description of a user interface, which may be specific to a concrete device or application and which indicates the forms of information presentation and interaction available to a user.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fsemantic-contextual-augmented-reality-environments">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
