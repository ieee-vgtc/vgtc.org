It has to be ensured that the building fits into the future environment. The Collaborative Design Platform targets this issue by integrating modern digital means with well known traditional concepts. Well-used styrofoam blocks are still cut by hand but are now tracked, placed and visualized in 3D by use of a tabletop platform and a TV screen showing an arbitrary view of the scenery. With this demonstration, we get one step further and provide an interactive visualization at the proposed building site, further enhancing collaboration between different audiences. Mobile phones and tablet devices are used to visualize marker-less registered virtual building structures and immediately show changes made to the models in the Collaborative Design laboratory. This way, architects can get a direct impression about how a building will integrate within the environment and residents can get an early impression about future plans.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fdemo-site-augmented-collaborative-architecture-visualization">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
