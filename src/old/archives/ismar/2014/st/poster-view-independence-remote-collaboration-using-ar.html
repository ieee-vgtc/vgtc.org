This is achieved by using a 3D scan and reconstruction of the user's environment. The remote user can place virtual objects in the scene that the local user views through a head mounted display (HMD), helping them place real objects. A user study tested how the amount of remote view independence affected collaboration. We found that increased view independence led to faster task completion, more user confiden), helping them place real objects. A user study tested how the amount of remote view independence affected collaboration. We found that increased view independence led to faster task completion, more user confidence, and a decrease in verbal communication, but object placement accuracy remained unchanged.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fst%2Fposter-view-independence-remote-collaboration-using-ar">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
