One such example is the Smart Headlight being developed at Carnegie Mellon Universitys Robotics Institute. The project team has been working on a new set of capabilities for the headlight, such as making rain drops and snowflakes disappear, allowing for the high beams to always be on without glare, and enhancing the appearance of objects of interest. This talk will present the idea, approach, and current status of the Smart Headlight Project.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fsmart-headlight-new-active-augmented-reality-improves-how-reality-appears-human">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
