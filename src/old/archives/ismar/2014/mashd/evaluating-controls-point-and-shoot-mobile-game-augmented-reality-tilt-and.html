A user study (n=12) was conducted to compare the three controls in terms of player experience and accuracy. Tilt and AR controls provided more enjoyment, immersion and accuracy to the players than Touch. Nonetheless, Touch caused fewer nuisances and was playable under more varied situations. Despite the current technical limitations, we suggest to incorporate AR controls into the mobile games that supported them. Nowadays, AR controls can be implemented on handheld devices as easily as the more established Tilt and Touch controls. However, this study is the first comparison of them and thus its findings could be of interest for game developers.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fmashd%2Fevaluating-controls-point-and-shoot-mobile-game-augmented-reality-tilt-and">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
