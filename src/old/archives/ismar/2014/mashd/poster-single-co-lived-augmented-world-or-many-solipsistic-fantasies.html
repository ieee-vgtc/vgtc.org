This work analyses what kind of relation between subjects and worlds are created by these two different kinds of worlds created from a phenomenological perspective. It will be clear how the production of such an augmented world cannot be solved by mere technical elements, but it has to deal with bigger problems.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fismar%2F2014%2Fmashd%2Fposter-single-co-lived-augmented-world-or-many-solipsistic-fantasies">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
