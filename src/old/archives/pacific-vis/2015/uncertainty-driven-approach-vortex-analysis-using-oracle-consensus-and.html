Local vortex detection methods are popular as they are efficient and easy to im- plement, and produce binary outputs based on a user-specified, hard threshold. However, vortices are global features, which present challenges for local detectors. On the other hand, global detec- tors are computationally intensive and require considerable user in- put. In this work, we propose a consensus-based uncertainty model and introduce spatial proximity to enhance vortex detection results obtained using point-based methods. We use four existing local vortex detectors and convert their outputs into fuzzy possibility val- ues using a sigmoid-based soft-thresholding approach. We apply a majority voting scheme that enables us to identify candidate vortex regions with a higher degree of confidence. Then, we introduce spa- tial proximity- based analysis to discern the final vortical regions. Thus, by using spatial proximity coupled with fuzzy inputs, we pro- pose a novel uncertainty analysis approach for vortex detection. We use expertâ€™s input to better estimate the system parameters and re- sults from two real-world data sets demonstrate the efficacy of our method.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2015%2Funcertainty-driven-approach-vortex-analysis-using-oracle-consensus-and">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
