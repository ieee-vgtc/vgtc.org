Exploration of such data requires a robust distance measure to compare scalar fields for tasks such as identifying key events and establishing correspondence between features in the data. Towards this goal, we propose a topological data structure called the complete extremum graph and define a distance measure on it for comparing scalar fields in a feature-aware manner. We design an algorithm for computing the distance and show its appli- cations in analysing time varying data.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2015%2Fdistance-between-extremum-graphs">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
