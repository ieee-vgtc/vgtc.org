In series production, many parts are controlled in various ways in some or all stages of assembly. While tactile measurements are mostly restricted to the points on an inspection plan, this restriction does not apply to optical measurements. We propose a method based on the theory of Pareto sets (multivariate topological analysis) to cope with the large amount of data produced by optical measurements and to find points of interest on the measured surface in addition to the inspection plan. We describe a method which automatically detects areas of systematic errors on a component and visualizes them on the triangulated surface. The visualization can help experts to decide, whether a detected feature is severe enough to be added to the inspection plan.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2015%2Fapplication-pareto-sets-quality-control-series-production-car">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
