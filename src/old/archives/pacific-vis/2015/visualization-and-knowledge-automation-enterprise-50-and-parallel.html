After waves of innovations in mechanical, electrical, information, and networking technologies, we are entering the new and fifth development stage of parallel technology with virtual-real duality, where enterprise 5.0, supported by software-defined plants or factories and cyber-physical-social systems, will be the infrastructure for coming intelligent manufacturing and smart industries. We believe visualization and knowledge automation will play a key role in this process of parallel virtual-real evolution towards smart living and working in a smart society.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2015%2Fvisualization-and-knowledge-automation-enterprise-50-and-parallel">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
