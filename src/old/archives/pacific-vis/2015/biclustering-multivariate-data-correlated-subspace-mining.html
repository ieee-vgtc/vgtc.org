If relying too much on effective enhancements in manual in- terventions, the associated results depend heavily on the knowledge and skills of users performing the data analysis. This paper presents a novel approach to extracting feature subspaces from multivari- ate data by incorporating biclustering techniques. The approach has been maximally automated in the sense that highly-correlated dimensions are automatically grouped to form subspaces, which effectively supports further exploration of them. A key idea be- hind our approach lies in a new mathematical formulation of asym- metric biclustering, by combining spherical k-means clustering for grouping highly-correlated dimensions, together with ordinary k- means clustering for identifying subsets of data samples. Lower- dimensional representations of data in feature subspaces are suc- cessfully visualized by parallel coordinate plot, where we project the data samples of correlated dimensions to one composite axis through dimensionality reduction schemes. Several experimental results of our data analysis together with discussions will be pro- vided to assess the capability of our approach.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2015%2Fbiclustering-multivariate-data-correlated-subspace-mining">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
