We present a visual analytic framework for dynamic multi-relational networks and a prototype implementation, called the MultiStory system, which includes two new visualisation methods, AlterCluster and InterArc, designed for dynamic networks with multiple relations. The system is evaluated with two case studies using social networks from the MIT Reality Commons to demonstrate the effectiveness of the system to support a variety of visual analytical tasks on dynamic multi-relational networks.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2015%2Fmultistory-visual-analytics-dynamic-multi-relational-networks">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
