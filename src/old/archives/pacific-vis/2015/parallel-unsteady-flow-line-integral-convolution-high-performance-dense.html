Our approach differs from previous implementations by using a novel value scattering+gathering mechanism to parallelize UFLIC and designing a pathline reuse strategy to reduce the computational cost of pathline integration. By exploiting the massive parallelism of modern graphical processing units (GPU), the proposed method allows for real-time dense visualization of unsteady flows with high spatialtemporal coherence.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2015%2Fparallel-unsteady-flow-line-integral-convolution-high-performance-dense">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
