In particular, stereoscopic and VR environments for graph visualization have only been applied as limited extensions to standard 2D techniques (e.g. using stereoscopy for highlighting). In this work, we explore a new, immersive approach for graph visualization, designed specifically for virtual reality environments.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2015%2Fspherical-layout-and-rendering-methods-immersive-graph-visualization">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
