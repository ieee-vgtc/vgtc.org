Proposed is a high-dimensional rotation technique called AGI3D, combined with an ability to filter elements based on social centrality values. AGI3D is targeted for a high-dimensional embedding of a social graph and its projection onto 3D space. It allows the user to ro- tate the social graph layout in the high-dimensional space by mouse dragging of a vertex. Its high-dimensional rotation effects give the user an illusion that he/she is destructively reshaping the social graph layout but in reality, it assists the user to find a preferred positioning and direction in the high- dimensional space to look at the internal structure of the social graph layout, keeping it unmodified. A prototype im- plementation of the proposal called Social Viewpoint Finder is tested with about 70 social graphs and this paper reports four of the analysis results.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2015%2Finteractive-high-dimensional-visualization-social-graphs">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
