The distances between spatial temporal samples are evaluated by their attribute values along the advection directions in the flow field. The massive samples are then projected into 2D screen space for feature identification and selection. A hybrid parallel system, which tightly integrates a MapReduce-style particle tracer with a scalable algorithm for massive projection, is designed to support the large scale analysis. Results show that the proposed methods and system are capable of visualizing features in the unsteady flow, which couples multivariate analysis of vector and scalar attributes with projection.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2014%2Fscalable-lagrangian-based-attribute-space-projection-multivariate-unsteady">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
