Currently, many countries are investing heavily in policy-making process development through the ICT for this purpose. In the policy cycle, there are many opportunities in which a scientific method can be effectively applied especially in the agenda setting. In the phase, it is important to visualize a cognitive structure in a citizen. We focus on the evaluation grid method to figure out the citizen's requirement. Once we construct the cognitive structure represented by a graph in which nodes and arcs are represented as constructs and relationships between them, respectively, we can develop a predictive cognitive model which will be useful in the agenda setting. For this purpose we employ multivariate visualization techniques which can figure out meaningful relationships in the cognitive model.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2014%2Fagenda-setting-policy-making-using-visualization-techniques">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
