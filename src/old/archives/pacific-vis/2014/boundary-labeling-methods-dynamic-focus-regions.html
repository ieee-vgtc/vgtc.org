Adapting the idea of boundary labeling using a focus region, we face the problem of emphasizing additional information and labels for objects within a focus region even when the region might be moving. We propose four different approaches that support effective solutions in various ways, and discuss advantages and drawbacks. Our algorithms regard the dynamic nature of the focus region to place the labels and preserve the mental map of the analyzed drawing. We demonstrate our methods by applying them to biological networks.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2014%2Fboundary-labeling-methods-dynamic-focus-regions">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
