Specifically, we propose a scheme to apply the rendering to transparent and fused visualization of recent large and complex laser-scanned data from cultural assets. Our scheme uses 3D points that are directly acquired using a laser scanner as the rendering primitives. For laser-scanned data that consist of more than 107 or 108 3D points, the pre-processing stage takes only a few minutes, and the rendering stage is executable at interactive frame rates. We do not encounter rendering artifacts originating from the indefiniteness of depth-sorted orders of rendering primitives. Fused visualization with various visual assistants is also possible. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our scheme by visualizing a campus building and a culturally important festival float.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2014%2Fapplication-stochastic-point-based-rendering-transparent-visualization">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
