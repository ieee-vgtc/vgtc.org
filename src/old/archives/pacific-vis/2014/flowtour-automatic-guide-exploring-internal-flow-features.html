Our algorithm first identifies critical regions and extracts their skeletons for feature characterization and streamline placement. We then create candidate viewpoints based on the construction of a simplified mesh enclosing each critical region and select best viewpoints based on a viewpoint quality measure. Finally, we design a tour that traverses all selected viewpoints in a smooth and efficient manner for visual navigation and exploration of the flow field. Unlike most existing works which only consider external viewpoints, a unique contribution of our work is that we also incorporate internal viewpoints to enable a clear observation of what lies inside of the flow field. Our algorithm is thus particularly useful for exploring hidden or occluded flow features in a large and complex flow field. We demonstrate our algorithm with several flow data sets and perform a user study to confirm the effectiveness of our approach.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2014%2Fflowtour-automatic-guide-exploring-internal-flow-features">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
