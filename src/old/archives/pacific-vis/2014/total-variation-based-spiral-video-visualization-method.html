Firstly, video data visualization design principles are proposed based on the analysis of video data characteristics. Secondly, a TV metric is proposed to measure the distance between two video frames. Then, video shots are detected by TV metric, and video key frames are extracted by K-means algorithm. Finally, according to the proposed video visualization design principles, a spiral video visualization method is proposed. Experimental results show that the proposed video visualization method can express the video content and the whole structure directly and clearly.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2014%2Ftotal-variation-based-spiral-video-visualization-method">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
