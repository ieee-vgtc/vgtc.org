Nevertheless, with increasing size of the information in the web-space, it has become very difficult to visualize information and the inherent relationships among the information. Because of web graphs being messy and large, end users need to allow extra effort to mine interested information from those. Existing web graphs produce relationships among nodes (URLs) based on structural linkage information. As a result, by producing similar visualization to different end users, this approach lacks effectiveness considering diversity of users' need. In our work, we encounter this issue of personalization in visualization of web graph. We propose a different web graph which capitalizes on user interests to develop relationships among nodes of the web graph. Examples show that this web graph can represent web information to the end user for more effective and effortless information search.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2014%2Fnew-type-web-graph-personalized-visualization">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
