This paper proposes a novel framework for inter-media comparison through visualizing images extracted from different types of media. We extract blog image clusters from our six-year blog archive and search for similar TV shots in each cluster from a broadcast news video archive by using image similarities. We then visualize such image flows on a timeline in 3D space to visually and interactively explore time sequential changes in influences among media resources and differences and/or similarities between them such as topics that become popular on only blogs or that become popular on blogs earlier than on TV.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2014%2Fimage-flows-visualization-inter-media-comparison">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
