In areas on the map densely populated by these objects, visual clutter and occlusion of glyphs occur. We propose a method to solve this problem by partitioning the set of all objects into subsets that are each visualized using an aggregated multivariate glyph that shows the distribution of several attributes of its objects, such as heading, type and velocity. We choose the combination of subsets and glyph design such that the glyphs do not overlap and the number of subsets is approximately maximal. The partition is maintained and updated while the objects move. We use examples from the maritime domain, but our method is applicable to a wider range of dynamic data. Through a user study we find that, for a set of representative tasks, our method does not perform significantly worse than competitive visualizations with respect to correctness. Furthermore, it performs significantly better for density comparison tasks in high density data sets. We also find that the participants of the user study have a preference for our method.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2014%2Fnon-overlapping-aggregated-multivariate-glyphs-moving-objects">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
