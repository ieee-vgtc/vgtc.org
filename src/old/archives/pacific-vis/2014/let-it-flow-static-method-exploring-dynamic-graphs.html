However there have been few visual analytics approaches that have been proposed to help analysts study graph evolutions in the context of graph metrics. In this paper, we present a novel approach, called GraphFlow, to visualize dynamic graphs. In contrast to previous approaches that provide users with an animated visualization, GraphFlow offers a static flow visualization that summarizes the graph metrics of the entire graph and its evolution over time. Our solution supports the discovery of high-level patterns that are difficult to identify in an animation or in individual static representations. In addition, GraphFlow provides users with a set of interactions to create filtered views. These views allow users to investigate why a particular pattern has occurred. We showcase the versatility of GraphFlow using two different datasets and describe how it can help users gain insights into complex dynamic graphs.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Fpacific-vis%2F2014%2Flet-it-flow-static-method-exploring-dynamic-graphs">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
