With the advent of high throughput se- quencing and the technical capability of unbiased and reasonably complete measurements of RNA and protein complements, this view as changed dramatically. The overwhelming majority of transcribed RNA exerts in function, which most likely is of regulatory nature, without ever being translated in protein. Functional RNAs can be identified by their conservation in evolutionary related organism, and often be the preservation of structural features even in the presence of large sequence divergence. The computa- tion and comparison of RNA structures give rise to a variety of challenging computational problems. In my presentation I will give an overview of the state of the art in RNA bioinformatics, with an emphasis on those topics and questions where modern visualization strategies could drastically improve the insights into the data and help the generation of new hypotheses: structure comparison, evolutionary changes in large, complex transcript networks, as well as genome-wide patterns in relation to a wide variety of other genomic features.<div id="disqus_thread"><noscript><p><a href="http://vgtc.disqus.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvgtc.org%2Farchives%2Feurovis%2F2013%2Fkeynote-%25E2%2580%2593-bioinformatics-non-coding-rnas">View the discussion thread.</a></p></noscript></div>  </div>
