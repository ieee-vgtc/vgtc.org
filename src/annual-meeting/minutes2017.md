  * 1002 registered, beyond target of 1K
  * 84K sponsorship, beyond target of 80K
  * pro event planner as crucial and most have large conf experience
  * mantras: keep it simple, no exceptions no surprises
  * scalable organization. all the docs are there.
  * inclusivity
  * new plenary awards opening
  * community: visbuddies to serve new people (1/3 new)
  * numbers roughly between 2013 (low/lean) and 2015 (high/flush).
  * estimate will have 40K surplus. would have been higher if not convention center plus hotel. f&b was set early, made right decision a few years back when did the contract signing.
  * hotel attrition was scary. could have been 50K, 70K, etc. two
    years running source of major stress. assumption about conference
    hotel isn't true, world has changed with airbnb etc. need to
    change. he sends shaming/begging mail. that won't work long term.
  * had a budget. for a few years page charges were 2K, 6K. then got
    mail saying it's 40K for this year and past 4 years. thanks to
    leila for passing along (ieee cs still hasn't sent us the invoice,
    only know this thanks to leila passing along as a headsup!)
  * arts: champagne tastes on a beer budget.
  * claudio: thanks. opening was amazing. one of the best he's ever seen. also great content.
