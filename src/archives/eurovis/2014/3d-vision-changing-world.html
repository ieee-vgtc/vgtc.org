However, these successes apply almost exclusively in a static world, where the only motion is that of the camera. Even with the advent of realtime depth cameras, full 3D modelling of dynamic scenes lags behind the rigid-scene case, and for many objects of interest (e.g. animals moving in natural environments), depth sensing remains challenging. In this talk, I will discuss a range of recent work in the modelling of nonrigid real-world 3D shape from 2D images, for example building generic animal models from internet photo collections. While the state of the art depends heavily on dense point tracks from textured surfaces, I will talk about recovering shape from largely textureless objects such as dolphins, by incorporating the strong constraints given by the object鈥檚 silhouette. <div class="field field-name-field-running-time field-type-text field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Running Time:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">00:51:27</div></div></div><div class="field field-name-field-vimeo field-type-video-embed-field field-label-above"><div class="field-label">Conference presentation:&nbsp;</div><div class="field-items"><div class="field-item even">
