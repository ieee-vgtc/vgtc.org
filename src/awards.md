The IEEE VGTC Awards program recognizes and honors individuals who have made a significant contribution to the community through their research and / or volunteer efforts. Each year, the Technical Achievement Awards are presented during the opening sessions of the annual Visualization and Virtual Reality conferences. The IEEE VGTC also routinely honors outstanding services with the IEEE Certificate of Appreciation. For extraordinary services to our community we honor volunteers with the IEEE Meritorious Service Award.
