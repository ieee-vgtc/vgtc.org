### About

The IEEE VGTC Visualization Pioneers Group (VPG) is a part of IEEE Visualization and Graphics Technical Committee (VGTC). A VPG membership brings several benefits:
  
- Access to the VPG reception at IEEE VIS conference
- A Visualization Pioneer lapel pin. The lapel pin indicates your special status in the community. 

Membership in the VPG is a privilege. Members honor their commitment to the future of visualization by supporting the group with their annual dues.

   

### MEMBERSHIP

VPG is an earned member category under VGTC.
  
- Membership is earned after 20 years of contributions to some aspect of visualization. All members of the visualization community are welcome&mdash;scientists, engineers, academics, artists, designers, salespersons, marketing representatives, etc.
- Members commit to perform some service to the visualization community. This service may include conference or journal paper reviews, financial support of the mentoring program, serving as a mentor, or some other service as needs and opportunities arise
- Member dues are USD $50 per year and support Pioneer activities including the mentorship initiative and the annual reception.

   

 ### MISSION

VPG is a networking, mentoring, advisory, and philanthropic organization. We gather yearly at a reception to meet old friends, make new ones, enjoy food and drinks, and listen to a distinguished speaker from the visualization community. The annual reception will be held during the IEEE VIS week.

Visualization Pioneers are passionate advocates of all aspects of visualization. We share our opinions with the VGTC to help shape our future direction.
