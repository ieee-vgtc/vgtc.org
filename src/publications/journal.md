Please use the following templates for Special Issue TVCG papers (VIS full papers, ISMAR, VR accepted Long Papers, PacificVis Papers etc.):

* [LaTeX Template](/attachments/publications/vgtc_journal_latex.zip) (last updated October 1, 2019)
* [Microsoft Word Template]() (latest version: July 19, 2015)
* [Sample PDF paper](/attachments/publications/vgtc_journal_template.pdf) (latest version: October 4, 2017)

These journal templates are **not** to be used by papers accepted as conference-only tracks, short papers, notes, workshops, panels, posters, contests/challenge, tutorials etc. Papers submitted to these tracks should use the [VGTC Conference Style Template](/publications/conference).

Please also note that these journal templates are **not** to be used for _regular_ TVCG journal submissions (i.e., those not related to the special journal issues of VIS, ISMAR, VR PacificVis, etc.). For such papers, including those submitted as fast track submissions, please use the [official TVCG templates](https://www.computer.org/csdl/journal/tg/write-for-us/15094?title=Author%20Information&periodical=IEEE%20Transactions%20on%20Visualization%20%26%20Computer%20Graphics) instead.

If you are unsure which template style you should be using, please contact the appropriate track chairs of your conference. All inquiries and questions about document _formatting_ can be directed to the VGTC Publications Chair at [submissions@vgtc.org](mailto:submissions@vgtc.org).

## Summary of Format

### Size and Margins

It is very important to follow these margins exactly or you run the risk of loosing text when the final paper is produced at a smaller trim size.

#### LaTeX

* _Paper Size_: 8.5 inches by 11.0 inches (21.59cm by 27.94cm)

* _Column Gutter_: 0.17 inches (0.4318 cm) column gutter

#### Microsoft Word

The page margins are slightly different when produced in Microsoft Word, as it automatically inserts a bit of blank space in the top and bottom margins.

### Images

* Teaser images are allowed and encouraged in Journal papers.
* Please do not include any other images/graphs/charts on the first page of your paper. 
* If possible, place all other images in one of the four corners of your pages.

### Header

* Please do **not** include headers in your paper. We will automate these for you with the appropriate information.

### Title

* _Title Text_: 18pt Helvetica, centered
* Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word).

### Author Information and Affiliation

* _Author Names_: 10pt Helvetica, centered
* _Author Information_ is specified in a comma separated list, the last one being attached with ', and'. If only two authors are given simply separate them with a single 'and'. IEEE Members should be indicated by appending 'Member, IEEE' or 'Student Member, IEEE', whichever applies.
* _Author Affiliation_ should be 10pt Times or Times New Roman.
* _Contact Information_ should be provided as a list in a separate footnote at the bottom of the first page in the left column. 
  * Please include each author's name, affiliation, and e-mail address, in bullet form with one bullet point per author.
  * Please insert punctuation at the end of each item. 

### Abstract

* Justified, indented an extra 0.33 inches from main body text of paper on inside and outside margins.
* The word _"Abstract"_: 8pt Helvetica, bold, justified, and **not numbered**.
* _Body Text_: up to 3 in. (7.62 cm) long.
* Abstract must be **1 paragraph**; any paper with multiple paragraphs will be returned for correction.

### Index Terms

* Left aligned, indented an extra 0.33 inches from main Body text of paper on inside and outside margins. In MS Word, if the Index Terms run more than one line, please justify so the far right is flush aligned except on the last line; we do not want the last line spacing stretched out to flush both left and right on the last line.
* The word _"Index Terms"_: 8pt Helvetica, bold, justified, and **not numbered**.
* Please only capitalize the first letter of the first word in the list, separating the words with commas
* Starting in 2013, a period (.) is no longer allowed at the end of the Index Terms
* A list of relevant index terms should be included after the abstract.
* Please think of these as being written in the style of Keywords, instead of the traditional ACM Index Terms (Looking at the sample PDF, might be of help.).
* Leave one blank line after Index terms.

### Diamond Rule

* Insert the _Diamond Rule_ (figure) after the _Index Terms_, centered.

### Manuscript Recevied Dates

* TVCG requires the _Manuscript Received_ dates at the bottom of page 1 to be left as is. 
* The most recent template version has made use of _'xxx'_ for the dates. 
* TVCG will populate the _'xxx'_: post-production with the actual dates. 
* No action from you is required.

### Headings

* _Section Headings_: 9pt Helvetica, bold, flush left, numbered, small caps.
* _Subsection Headings_: 9pt Helvetica, bold, flush left, numbered.
* _Sub-subsection Headings_: 9pt Helvetica, flush left, numbered.

### Body Text

* 9pt Times or Times New Roman, justified on 10pt leading
indent all paragraphs by 1em (roughly 3mm) except the first one under a heading.
* No blank lines between paragraphs.

### Caption Text

* 8pt Helvetica.
* Figures and tables must be numbered separately.
* Figure captions are to be flush left below the figures.
  * Please number each figure in the following manner: _'Fig.#.'_, followed by the title, using the appropriate punctuation.
  * Capitalize the first word of each sentence in the figure caption.
* Table titles are to be centered above the tables. 
* Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word) of each figure caption.

### Acknowledgments

* The word _"ACKNOWLEDGMENTS"_: 9pt Helvetica, bold, flush left, small caps, and **not numbered**.
* _Body Text_: 9pt Times or Times Roman.
* In the USA, it is spelled ‘acknowledgments’, without the ‘e’ after the ‘g’. Since the IEEE is a USA based society, we would recommend having it spelled ‘acknowledgments’ and have done that in our template. However, for the rest of the world, we will not correct it in conference papers - we also spell it ‘acknowledgements’ with an ‘e’ after the ‘g’.

### Citations and References

* The word _"REFERENCES"_: 9pt Helvetica, bold, flush left, small caps, and **not numbered**.
* _List of references_: 8pt Times or Times Roman on 9.5pt leading.
* When referenced in the text, enclose the citation number in square brackets (e.g., _[1]_).
* Where appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books. For example:

  [1] Albert B. Smith, Christopher D. Jones, and Egon F. Roberts, "Article Title", Journal, Publisher, Location, pp. 1-10, Date. 

  [2] Christopher D. Jones, Albert B. Smith, and Egon F. Roberts, Book Title, Publisher, Location, Date. 
  
  [3] Christopher D. Jones, Albert B. Smith, and Egon F. Roberts, "Chapter Title", Book Title, Book Editors, Publisher, Location, Date.
