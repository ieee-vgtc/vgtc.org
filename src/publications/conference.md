* Capitalize the first letter of nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs; do not capitalize articles, coordinate conjunctions, or prepositions (unless the title begins with such a word). Capitalize the second word in compound words if it is a noun or proper adjective or the words have equal weight (Cross-Reference, Run-Time).
* Leave two blank lines after the title.

### Author list and Affiliation

* _Author Names_: 10pt Helvetica (or Arial), centered.
* _Multiple authors_: multiple columns.
* Affiliation should include full names, company / institution identification, and email addresses.
* Affiliations are centered below each author name in 8pt, not bold.
* Include e-mail addresses as a footnote with a horizontal rule above the footnote area.
* Follow the author information by two blank lines before main text.

### Copyright Space

* A 0.5 inch (1.18 cm) space must be left at the bottom of the left column on the first page of the paper for the copyright information added during the printing process.

### Abstract

* The word _"ABSTRACT"_: 9pt Helvetica (or Arial), bold, flush left, small caps, and **not numbered**. 
* _Abstract content_ begins on a new line.
* _Body Text_: 9pt Times or Times Roman, justified on 10pt leading; up to 3 in. (7.62 cm) long. 
* Leave one blank line after the abstract.

### Keywords

* The word _"Keywords"_: 9pt Times or Times Roman, bold, flush left, and **not numbered**.
* _Body Text_: 9pt Times or Times Roman, justified on 10pt leading.
* Capitalize the first letter of the first keyword.
* Include a period (.) at the end of the keywords.
* Descriptors from the ACM Computing Classification System, located at https://www.acm.org/about-acm/class, should be used.
* A list of relevant keywords should be included at the end of the abstract.

### Index Terms

* The words _"Index Terms"_: 9pt Times or Times Roman, bold, flush left, and **not numbered**.

### Body Text

* 9pt Times or Times Roman, justified on 10pt leading
indent all paragraphs by 1em (roughly 3mm) except the first one under a heading.
* No blank lines between paragraphs.

### Caption Text

* 8pt Helvetica (or Arial)
* Capitalize only the first word of each figure caption.
* Capitalize in sentence case for a table title/caption; try to limit the table captions to a simple title and not a full description.
* Figures and tables must be numbered separately and should be labelled _'Figure:'_ or _'Table:'_ (note the use of a colon **not** a period).
* Figure captions are to be centered below the figures. 
  * When the caption expands across multiple lines, it should become flush left.
* Table titles/captions are to be centered above the tables.

### Acknowledgments

* The word _"ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS"_: 9pt Helvetica (or Arial), bold, flush left, small caps, and **not numbered**.
* _Body Text_: 9pt Times or Times Roman, justified on 10pt leading.
* In the USA, it is spelled ‘acknowledgments’, without the ‘e’ after the ‘g’. Since the IEEE is a USA based society, we would recommend having it spelled ‘acknowledgments’ and have done that in our template. However, for the rest of the world, we will not correct it in conference papers - we also spell it ‘acknowledgements’ with an ‘e’ after the ‘g’.

### Citations and References

* The word _"REFERENCES"_: 9pt Helvetica (or Arial), bold, flush left, small caps, and **not numbered**.
* _Body Text_: 9pt Times or Times Roman, justified on 10pt leading.
* _List of references_: 8pt Times or Times Roman on 9.5pt leading.
* When referenced in the text, enclose the citation number in square brackets (e.g., _[1]_).
* Where appropriate, include the name(s) of editors of referenced books. For example:

  [1] Albert B. Smith, Christopher D. Jones, and Egon F. Roberts, "Article Title", Journal, Publisher, Location, pp. 1-10, Date. 

  [2] Christopher D. Jones, Albert B. Smith, and Egon F. Roberts, Book Title, Publisher, Location, Date. 
  
  [3] Christopher D. Jones, Albert B. Smith, and Egon F. Roberts, "Chapter Title", Book Title, Book Editors, Publisher, Location, Date.
